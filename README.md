🚀 LinkitKernel: Pure & Clean Edition
This release provides a completely clean kernel without any pre-installed root (No KernelSU, No APatch). It is designed specifically for users who prioritize system stability and need to pass integrity checks for banking and official apps.
📋 Why this version?
This update was created because many users complained about banking apps not working due to root detection. In the current mobile landscape, built-in root is often more of a hurdle than a benefit—especially since game hacking is largely a thing of the past and most users value a secure, "clean" environment.
